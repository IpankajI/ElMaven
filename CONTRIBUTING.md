## Commit Guidelines
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters- it's a rule of thumb. Follow it strictly
  as long as possible, otherwise long subject line will get truncated.
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line i.e. as you are giving order.
* keep the length of line in body at 72 character.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs how in consize manner i.e. no story telling 
  and no inferential statements. Explain these three things to the point.
